        Deprecated $user_autocreated. It was being used to prevent a call
        to RT::User::UpdateFromExternal in User_Vendor.pm because it was
        deemed an unecessary expense to set the user's info and then look
        it up again straight after. However, I have since realised that
        UpdateFromExternal is the only code doing a check to see if the
        user has been disabled in the external source and so bypassing
        it when users are created allows new users to log in once even
        if they have not been "enabled". 

        I will be doing a small rewrite of this code in the future to
        abstract the External disable-lookup code from UpdateFromExternal
        and perhaps remove the function altogether, but for now everything
        will work fine.
