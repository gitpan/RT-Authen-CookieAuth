RT-Authen-CookieAuth

This module provides the ability to seamlessly integrate
RT with a website that uses browser cookies to keep users
authenticated once they have logged in.

This module requires the RT-Authen-ExternalAuth extension,
although if you do not wish to install the full extension,
you may simply provide a valid ExternalSettings variable
containing a database configuration as documented in the
RT_SiteConfig.pm distributed with RT-Authen-ExternalAuth.

This module is designed to read the value of a browser
cookie and check it against a database table containing
stored cookie values and userIDs and a users table matching 
userIDs to usernames.

If the stored cookie value matches a valid userID, then
the username associated with it will be automatically
authenticated in RT.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Once installed, you should view the file:

    $RTHOME/local/etc/CookieAuth/RT_SiteConfig.pm

Then use the example provided to prepare your own custom
configuration which should reside in
$RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm

Alternatively, you may alter the provided example directly
and then include the extra directives by including the
example file's path at the end of your RT_SiteConfig.pm
